This directory contains additional files necessary to
create cddmathlink.  It does not follow the autoconfig
structure and the user must edit Makefile so that it
conforms to the local Mathematica installation.
In particular, Mathematica MathLink executables
and library files (distributed as Mathematica AddOn
package, MathLink/DeveloperKit) must be installed properly.  
Namely, the executables mcc and mprep are typically 
installed in /usr/local/bin, the library libML.a
in /usr/local/lib, and the header file mathlink.h
in /usr/local/include.

Once a correct Makefile is created, just type 
"make all" or "make ml".  

Before cddmathlink compilation, one must compile 
the cddlib libraries (libcdd.a and libcddgmp.a) which are
supposed to be in the lib-src and lib-src-gmp directories.  

There is a new version of cddmathlink, called
cddmathlink2 which supports rational exact arithmetic with GMP.
