* This input file is an example for generating
* integral solutions to the following system of linear inequalities:
* 10 x1 + 7 x2  <= 70
* 11 x1 + 5 x2  >= 55
*    x1 >= 0,  x2 >= 0
* By using the fact that  0<=x1<=7 and 0<=x2<=10, we apply
* the (binary representation) substitution:
    x1 =         4 x13 + 2 x12 + x11  (all binary variables)
    x2 = 8 x24 + 4 x23 + 2 x22 + x21  (all binary variables) 
* The reduced system of linear inequalities is the input data.
* Since all integral (i.e. 0-1) solutions are extreme points,
* the integral extreme points are in one-to-one correspondence
* with the integral solutions to the original system.  In this
* example, there are 194 extreme points among which 10 are
* integral (0-1) solutions.
