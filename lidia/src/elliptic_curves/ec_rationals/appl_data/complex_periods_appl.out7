Enter a curve: Minimal model E1 = [1,0,0,-1070,7812]
Periods of [1,0,0,-1070,7812] are:
omega_1: (0.5129665050097666315838565942842701045585,0)
omega_2: (0.326204617220376048345387201491230071343e-111,0.4309028743584948650112829254396820581247)
tau: (0.6359179674200467959209942640030531009763e-111,0.8400214636826836965757875005387554278969)	(normalization: lattice type 2)
Curve reconstructed from those periods = [1,0,0,-1070,7812]
Curves are the same!
