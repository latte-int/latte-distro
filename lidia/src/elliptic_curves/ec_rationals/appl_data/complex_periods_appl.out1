Enter a curve: Minimal model E1 = [1,-1,0,4,3]
Periods of [1,-1,0,4,3] are:
omega_1: (2.780740013766729771063197627181358499391,0)
omega_2: (1.390370006883364885531598813590679249695,1.068749776356193066159263547437503878759)
tau: (0.5,0.384340057346277378136082528453807281998)	(normalization: lattice type 1)
Curve reconstructed from those periods = [1,-1,0,4,3]
Curves are the same!
