This is LattE corretto, a source code distribution of a version of
LattE with all prerequisite libraries.

Except for the optional library LiDIA, all software
included in this distribution is free software.

To build:

   ./configure
   make

Some of the C++ libraries are very picky about the version of the C++
compiler.  It works with GCC 3.3.2 and 3.3.4.  Older ones or newer
ones might not work.  To ensure a specific compiler is used, type:

   ./configure CC=/path/to/your/gcc CXX=/path/to/your/g++
   make

In particluar, cdd+ does not seem to compile with GCC 3.4.5.

The pickiest of all C++ libraries used is LiDIA.  As a last resort,
you can turn off using LiDIA:

   ./configure --disable-lidia
   make

If you have a multiprocessor machine, be sure to use it to shorten the
compile time by parallelizing the build:  For instance,

   make -j4


When the build process is finished, you will find all binaries in the
directory dest/bin.  The binaries might depend on shared libraries
installed in dest/lib, so add this directory to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH
(and dest/bin to your PATH).

I hope this LattE distribution works for you.  Please report any
failures, so we can improve the distribution and also LattE itself.
